## About

Pr. Police is a slackbot that sends to configured slack channels a listing of open pull requests that are waiting for a review. It supports watching multiple repositories, and filtering the pull requests by label.

This project is part of the Talkdesk Hackathon April 2017.

## Roadmap v2.0

We are targeting the following features for the v2.0 release:
- [ ] Support multiple teams in a single application instance (each team with their own repository, channels, ... configurations);
- [ ] Publish messages to multiple Slack Channels;
- [ ] Support multiple Github repositories;
- [ ] Schedule messages in a cron like fashion;
- [ ] PR exclusion/inclusion through PR tags;
